So you are the man my boss ask me to find.

Yep!

What you want from us?

I need someone for delivery a briefcase
to the leader of Izanagi at Edenchester.
I was told that you were the best.

For what reason you gonna need me to
delivery a simple briefcase, anyone
can doing it?

Yes that true but this briefcase
contain sensitive information, i realy
dont whant them out in the nature.
Plus if you succeed this job that could
end the tension between factions.

I'm skeptical at your real intention,
and i'm not interested in
political issues.

Look at the reward before
taking any decision.

!

Can I count on you for this mission?

I accept your proposition.

Well in this case take this. And I wish
you good luck, you gonna need it.

Luck is for amateurs.
